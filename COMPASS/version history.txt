software tools for OMSSA," Proteomics 11:1074–1084 
(2011)

1.2.8.0 (Wednesday, August 18, 2013)
- TagQuant -> 1.4.0.0
  Fixed noise band cap bug in which noise band PC values were 100 times to large

- Phosphinator -> 1.0.0.0
  Made compatible with new TagQuant outputs.

1.2.7.0 (Thursday, August 8, 2013)
- TagQuant -> 1.1.0.0
  Completely reworked tag quant

1.2.6.0 (Thursday, August 8, 2013)
- Lotor -> 1.0.0.0
  Added program LOcalize TO Residue (Lotor) for PTM localization.

- Replace Matrix package CSML with MathNet.Numerics

1.2.5.0 (Tuesday, August 6, 2013)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.4.1.0
  New algorithm for finding subsumable protein groups greatly speeds up the slowest
  step of the program.

1.2.4.0 (Monday, August 5, 2013)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.4.0.0
  Enabled semi-digestion searches
  If the digestion method of mapping fails to find every peptide, it will automatically
  switch to a brute force string search on the remaining unmapped peptides. 

1.2.3.0 (Thursday, July 11, 2013)
- DTA Generator Updated -> 1.0.2.0
  Reenabled logging of precursor information in the text log file

1.2.2.0 (Friday, March 22, 2013)
- DTA Generators Updated -> 1.0.1.0
  Would erroneously grab the precursor m/z from the previous MS1 instead of the
  MS1 scan that actually triggered the MS/MS scan.

1.2.1.0 (Tuesday, Feburary 12, 2013)
- FDR Optimizer Updated
  Wasn't handling dual modified sites correctly (i.e. TMT and Acetyl on the same lysine)

1.2.0.0 (Monday, September 10, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.3.0.0
  Streamelined the results for uniprot-based databases to quickly filter out the
  Uniprot ID and Gene Names. General improvements as well.

  Removed Protein Herder and Protein Taq Quant from the choices of nodes since they
  are replaced by Protein Hoarder.

1.1.9.0 (Thursday, August 2, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.5.0
  Error in when the largest peptide identified was also an N-terminal peptide, 
  the digestion algorithm would miss it.

1.1.7.0 (Thursday, February 23, 2012)
- Error in Non-batch High Res FDR Optimizer in which it was not correctly getting the
  right MS1 scans for each MS/MS peptide hit. 

1.1.6.2 (Saturday, January 28, 2012)
- DTA generator would perform really slowly if there weren't any MS1 scans.
  Fixed it by checking for all the MS1 scans at the beginning and storing them
  in a time-saving array for quick look ups.

1.1.6.1 (Friday, January 06, 2012)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.4.0
  Fixed a bug in which the peptide start and stop residues would not 
  be mapped to the representative protein.

1.1.5.3 (Tuesday, November 22, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.3.1
  Included outputs to spit out the number of PSMs and unique
  peptide sequences for each protein group based on the experiment
  ids.

1.1.4.0 (Thursday, November 17, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.2.0
  Included interference filtering for quantitation values
  to exclude PSM that have too much interference in their
  isolation window (Original Quant Mode)

1.1.3.0 (Thursday, November 10, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.2.1.0
  Refactored the code to dramtically decreases memory 
  consumption. It also now includes protein quantitation
  module so that Protein Tag Quant is no longer needed.
  Includes experimental details in which proteins can be
  grouped acrossed experiments but individual quantitation is
  determined on a experiment-by-experiment basis.

1.1.2.0 (Caturday!, September 17, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder -> 2.1.1.0
  Fixed a bug in which Proteins that contain the amino acid
  character 'X' would not be digested correctly. It now trims
  all 'X's from the N-term and C-Term of the protein before
  digestion.

1.1.1.0 (Monday, August 29, 2011)
- Protein Hoarder improvements. Can read in any omssa
  csv file now and correctly parses it. 

1.1.0.1 (Monday, August 15, 2011)
- Added a new program called "Protein Hoarder" which
  will replace protein herder. This version is considerably
  faster than protein herder.

1.0.5.1 (Wednesday, August 10, 2011)
- Forces application to run in 32-bit mode no matter
  the operating system capacity.

1.0.4.5 (Tuesday, August 09, 2011)
- TagQuant nows records the noiseband intensity if a
  certain reporter tag cannot be found.

1.0.4.4 (Monday, April 18, 2011)
- Modified the way OMSSA Navigator handles input files
  so the file-extension can be read correctly.

1.0.4.3 (Monday, April 4, 2011)
- Added support for raw files prior to Xcalibur 2.1 
  to TagQuant.

1.0.4.2 (Wednesday, March 16, 2011)
- Fixed bug in OMSSA Navigator for output files with 
  spaces in their filepaths.

1.0.4.1 (Wednesday, March 2, 2011)
- Better handling of interference removal in 
  ProteinTagQuant.

1.0.4.0 (Friday, January 7, 2011)

  to DTA Generator, FDR Optimizer, and Batch FDR 
  Optimizer.

1.0.3.4 (Friday, January 7, 2011)
- Fixed bug in launching Coondornator (internal 
  version only).

1.0.3.3 (Friday, January 7, 2011)
- Updated citation and link in about box.

1.0.3.2 (Thursday, January 6, 2011)
- Fixed bug: when run inside COMPASS, OMSSA Navigator 
  would crash when closed while a search was running.

1.0.3.1 (Wednesday, January 5, 2011)
- Added taxids.txt file (configurable list of 
  taxonomy IDs for limiting OMSSA searches).
- Updated about box.

1.0.3.0 (Tuesday, January 4, 2011)
- Added support for specifying taxonomy IDs to search 
  in OMSSA Navigator.
- Added support for dragging-and-dropping/browsing 
  for OMSSA modification .xml files.
- Fixed minor bug in FDR Optimizers: q-values were 
  not being output with enough precision. For the 
  batch versions, this could lead to slightly 
  incorrect numbers of identifications.

1.0.2.7 (Tuesday, January 4, 2011)
- Added support for multi-part databases to OMSSA 
  Navigator.

1.0.2.6 (Tuesday, December 21, 2010)
- Modified OMSSA Navigator to specify database 
  filepaths with escaped quotes rather than short 
  (8.3) filepaths.

1.0.2.5 (Monday, December 20, 2010)
- Fixed bug in DTA Generator where only two decimal 
  places were being used for precursors.

1.0.2.4 (Thursday, December 16, 2010)
- Fixed bug in finding mods.xml in OMSSA Navigator.

1.0.2.3 (Thursday, December 16, 2010)
- Modified OMSSA Navigator to search files in place 
  without making temporary copies.
- Fixed bug where output folder was ignored in OMSSA 
  Navigator.
- Fixed searching animation in OMSSA Navigator.
- Updated citation ("under review" -> "accepted").

1.0.2.2 (Wednesday, December 15, 2010)
- Fixed bug in summary.csv output of non-batch FDR 
  Optimizer (FT MS^1 and non-FT MS^1 versions).

1.0.2.1 (Thursday, December 9, 2010)
- Updated green icon (easier to see).

  de-isotoping, fragment intensity filtering, and 
  top n peaks filtering from DTA Generator.

1.0.0.2 (Friday, December 3, 2010)
- Fixed logic for recognizing a valid database in 
  OMSSA Navigator.

1.0.0.1 (Friday, December 3, 2010)
- Search first forward ion incorrectly labeled as 
  "-sb" instead of "-sb1" in OMSSA Navigator.

1.0.0.0 (Wednesday, December 1, 2010)
- Initial release.
